Once someone opens the app, it'll show a list of some categories. These categories are referring to a menu 
with those kinds of dishes.
The user can choose one of them and the app will navigate to the second screen. Which is the MenuActivity. 
This activity shows several dishes with a photo and it's price. In case the user is interested in one of the dishes, by clicking it, 
the app will show a description. The description is some extra information about what's in this delicious meal.
